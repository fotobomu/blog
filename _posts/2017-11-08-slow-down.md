title:  "On to JavaScript, and slowing down"
author: "Geoff"

I'm taking little break from working on HTML and CSS so I could dive head-first into JavaScript. Learning the basics and syntax of JavaScript was pretty straightforward. However, as soon as I was released to create something on my own I hit a brick wall: I actually didn't know what to do. This resulted in me feeling incredibly discouraged, as I felt that I had wasted hours on learning materials (Free Code Camp, The Odin Project, YouTube, etc.).

One step forward, several steps back.

So I'm going to take things a little slower, more methodically, and not getting ahead of myself. I realize this means it will take longer to get to "the good parts" of web development, but what use is there in rushing?

I wish this post could have been an opportunity to share a super-cool piece of JavaScript code. Instead, I'll leave you with the planning stages of a "To-do List" program.

{% highlight js %}
// To Do List Requirements:

// It should have a place to store tasks.
var todos = ['item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3']

// It should have a way to display tasks.
console.log(todos)

// It should have a way to add new task.
todos.push('item 4')

// It should have a way to change a task.
todos[0] = 'item 1 updated'

// It should have a way to delete a task.
todos.splice(0, 1)
{% endhighlight %}
