After just a few weeks into my part-time web development course I've gained a lot more confidence in how I approach web design. Opening up my text editor and starting a webpage from scratch takes almost no time at all (let's be honest though, I finally learned about snippets/emmet and I lament the days I worked without them).

Practice makes perfect, so I've found new opportunities to build websites from the ground-up. Here are a couple, very simple, websites I built in the past couple of weeks.

_A simple and clean website for Samia Madwar, the Managing Editor at <em>The Walrus Magazine</em>. <a href="https://fotobomu.github.io/samia-madwar/" target="_blank">View it live</a>._

_A project for my web development class. We were given a PSD and a style guide and had to code the website based on the specifications. <a href="https://fotobomu.github.io/mobi-project/" target="_blank">View it live</a>._
